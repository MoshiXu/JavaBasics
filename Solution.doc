1.
Multitasking: Running more than 1 program at the same time. If the computer has only one CPU, it has to switch between the programs.
Multiprocessing: When we have more than 1 CPU, we say it is multi-processing when running more than 1 program at the same time.
Multitherading: When we have more than 1 thread running in parallel to perform multiple tasks within an application.


2. Join
Thread class provides the join() method which allows one thread to wait until another thread completes its execution.


3. state of thread lifecycle

4.  synchronized keyword

Using synchronized blocks could lead to deadlock.

5.  Deadlock
Deadlock can occur in a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock, 
that is acquired by another thread and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is acquired by first thread

6. To prevent deadlock
Order of lock: To prevent a deadlock, the order of acquiring locks should be in the same order. This would prevent a deadlock.
Using Lock interface and specifying timeout: Lock is an interface, we may use the implementation class: Reentrant Lock.

7. Difference between synchronized block and method 
i is a local variable and the value is not being shared among threads.
Using a synchronzied method in this case would slow down the operation. 
 1) Synchronized block generally reduce scope of lock

execute in parrellel

8. Access and Non Access Modifiers in Java
Access 
 public, private, and protected.

Non Access Modifiers in Java
 static
final
abstract
synchronized
transient
volatile
native

In which case where finallly won't run
----> try{syso.exit(0);}finally{}
 //terminate the program
