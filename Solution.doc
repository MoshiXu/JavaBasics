1.
Multitasking: Running more than 1 program at the same time. If the computer has only one CPU, it has to switch between the programs.
Multiprocessing: When we have more than 1 CPU, we say it is multi-processing when running more than 1 program at the same time.
Multitherading: When we have more than 1 thread running in parallel to perform multiple tasks within an application.

4.  synchronized keyword

Using synchronized blocks could lead to deadlock.

5.  Deadlock
Deadlock can occur in a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock, 
that is acquired by another thread and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is acquired by first thread

Difference between synchronized block and method 
i is a local variable and the value is not being shared among threads.
Using a synchronzied method in this case would slow down the operation.
